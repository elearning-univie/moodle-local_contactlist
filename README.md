Description
-----------

The contactlist plugin allows students to decide if they want to share their contact information
with their fellow students in accordance with the GDPR for each course they are registered in.

* The default setting:

  Students have the option to set their contactlist visibility for the whole platform in their 
  profile settings page. The default visibility setting is "no", so students have to consciously
  opt-in if they want to share their contact information with their fellow students. 

* Course level setting:

  In order to provide maximum flexibility, students also have the option to set their contact information
  visibility in each course individually, overwriting the default setting for the respective course.
  
Requirements
------------
The plugin is available for Moodle 3.10+.

Installation
------------

* Copy the module code directly to the *moodleroot/local/contactlist* directory.

* Log into Moodle as administrator.

* Open the administration area (*http://your-moodle-site/admin*) to start the installation
  automatically.

Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform,
database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/elearning-univie/moodle-local_contactlist/issues/). Please
provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if applicable, a
screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful
and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the
resources to provide detailed support.
